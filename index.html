            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>Some restaurants, like the Bojangle's and Panda Express acually accept flex, which should be included in any default
                meal plan, which means that you dont have to spend your own money all the time! Restaurants, like Chipotle offer student
            discounts, like the Chipotle-U program. </p>
